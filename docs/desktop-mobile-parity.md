# Desktop ↔ Mobile Parity Tracker

Single source of truth for "what exists on desktop vs mobile". One row = one
capability = one manual test case. Fill the **Mobile** / **Desktop** cells as
features land; use the Notes column for decisions ("mobile does X instead").

**Update rule:** any PR that adds/changes a screen, modal, or confirmation
updates the matching rows here (same PR). New feature → add a row first,
implement second.

## Legend

| Mark | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| ✅ | Implemented & verified by hand |
| 🟡 | Partial — works but reduced (see Notes) |
| ❌ | Missing |
| ➖ | Not applicable by design (intentionally different pattern) |
| ❓ | Unverified — test and replace with ✅/🟡/❌ |

## How mobile works (testing notes)

- Mobile layout is **breakpoint-gated, not platform-gated**: `useIsMobile()` =
  `(max-width: 768px)` (`src/shared/hooks/useIsMobile.ts`). Test in a desktop
  browser's responsive mode at ≤768px; no native build needed.
- Mobile chrome = `MobileShell` (bottom tab bar), desktop chrome = `AppShell`
  (sidebar). Routes are shared; some routes swap to a dedicated mobile screen,
  the rest render the **desktop page inside the mobile shell** (interim state).
- Mobile styles live in `src/styles/45-mobile.css`.

### Route → implementation map

| Route | Desktop impl | Mobile impl | Mobile status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/today` | `TodayPage.tsx` | `TodayMobile.tsx` | Dedicated mobile screen |
| `/today/alerts` | — (redirects to `/today`) | `TodayAlertsMobile.tsx` | Mobile-only page |
| `/goals` | `GoalsPage.tsx` | `GoalsMobileList` (inside `GoalsPage.tsx`) | Dedicated mobile list |
| `/goals/:goalId` | `GoalDetailPage` (in `GoalsPage.tsx`) | `GoalDetailMobile.tsx` | Dedicated mobile screen |
| `/plan` | `PlanPage.tsx` | same desktop page in shell | ❌ no mobile variant, no tab entry |
| `/focus` | `FocusPage.tsx` → `Pomodoro.tsx` | same page in shell | ❓ needs mobile QA pass |
| `/notes` | `NotesPage.tsx` | same desktop page in shell | ❌ no mobile variant |
| `/settings` | `SettingsPage.tsx` | same desktop page in shell | ❌ no mobile variant, no tab entry |
| `/` (logged out) | `AuthPage.tsx` (Sprout) | same page | ❓ responsive state unverified |
| `/friends` | `FriendsPage.tsx` | same desktop page in shell | 🟡 renders in mobile shell, no tab entry |
| `/invite/:code` | `InviteLandingPage.tsx` (public, no shell) | same page | ✅ standalone responsive card |
| Add/Edit task | `AddTaskModal.tsx` | `AddTaskModalMobile.tsx` | Dedicated, heavily reduced (see §3) |

| Add goal | ✅ | ✅ FAB | Both open `GoalEditorModal` |

## 6. Goal detail

Desktop `GoalDetailPage` vs `GoalDetailMobile`.

| Capability | Desktop | Mobile | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Summary hero (icon, dates, status, progress) | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Edit goal | ✅ editor modal | ✅ full-screen edit page | Owner-only for shared goals; members edit goal content, not metadata |
| Delete goal (with confirm) | ✅ `window.confirm` | ❓ | Mobile has trash icon — verify confirm exists |
| Task list + per-task progress | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Empty goal starter options | ✅ | ✅ | `Add a first step` opens the existing step/task flow; future goal types are present but disabled until their workflows exist |
| Add goal task | ✅ inline row | ✅ create page | |

| Share goal with a friend (owner) | ✅ `ShareGoalControl` popover | ❌ | `GoalDetailMobile` has no share control yet |
| Member avatar stack on shared goal | ✅ `GoalMembersBar` | ❌ | |
| "Completed by X" attribution on tasks/subtasks | ✅ `CompletedByTag` | ❌ | Server sets `completed_by`; mobile doesn't render it |
| Shared-goal member content editing | ✅ add/edit/delete/reorder tasks, subtasks, and task notes | ✅ add/edit/delete tasks, subtasks, and task notes | Members are content admins by default; metadata/share/delete stay owner-only until finer permissions exist |

## 7. Goal editor (create/edit modal)

Shared component; mobile gets sheet styling (`45-mobile.css`).

| Capability | Desktop | Mobile | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Name, deadline | ✅ | ✅ | Create no longer includes task creation |
| Goal icon picker | ✅ | ❓ | |
| Start / target dates | ✅ | ❓ | |

|---|---|---|---|
| Full-page timer on `/focus` | ✅ | ❓ | Sizing/layout at ≤768px |
| Mode toggle (focus / short / long break) | ✅ | ❓ | |

| Date filter | ✅ | ❌ | |
| New note / editor | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Fullscreen editor | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Pin / unpin | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Delete note + confirm | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Note category picker | ✅ | ❌ | |

## 11. Settings

|---|---|---|---|

| Mobile layout | ➖ | ❌ | |
| Profile: photo upload + crop modal + delete | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Profile: name / details / country combobox | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Danger zone (account actions) | 🟡 placeholder | ❌ | |
| Tasks: category rename + color | ✅ | ❌ | |
| Tasks: category delete modal (detach vs delete-tasks) | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ delete-tasks also wipes recurring series of that category |
| Goals: journey widget toggle | ✅ | ❌ | Toggle only affects desktop Today |

| Continue with Google | ✅ | ❓ | |

## 13. Friends

Social graph + invite-code sharing. Desktop renders in `AppShell`; mobile
renders the same `FriendsPage` inside `MobileShell` (no dedicated mobile screen
yet). The invite landing (`/invite/:code`) is a standalone public page.

| Capability | Desktop | Mobile | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Friends list (avatar + name) | ✅ | 🟡 | Same page in shell; no tab/"More" entry |
| Add friend modal (own invite link + copy) | ✅ `AddFriendModal` | 🟡 | Renders in shell |
| Generate a new invite link (revokes old) | ✅ | 🟡 | |
| Add by pasted link or code | ✅ | 🟡 | Parses full URL or bare code |
| Remove friend (inline confirm) | ✅ two-step inline | 🟡 | Quiet trash icon → "Remove? / Cancel" |
| Invite landing preview (who invited) | ✅ | ✅ | Authed preview; standalone card |
| Accept invite → become friends | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Logged-out invite → sign in then return | ✅ | ✅ | Code stashed in `sessionStorage`, `PublicOnly` redirects back |
| Invalid/expired/revoked/self/already-friends states | ✅ | ✅ | Shown on landing card |

## 14. Modals & confirmations inventory

Quick cross-reference — every dialog in the app and where it can fire.

| Dialog | Source | Desktop | Mobile |
|---|---|---|---|
| Add/Edit task | `AddTaskModal` / `AddTaskModalMobile` | ✅ | 🟡 reduced |
| Completion scope (today vs whole goal task) | removed | ➖ | ➖ |
| Close parent goal task? | removed | ➖ | ➖ |
| Disable repeat confirm | `RepeatDisableConfirm` (AddTaskModal) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete recurring: single/future/series | `RepeatDeleteConfirm` (AddTaskModal) | ✅ | ❌ |

| Delete goal confirm | `window.confirm` (goal detail) | ✅ | ❌ (swipe deletes silently) |
| Goal occurrence delete scope | `GoalOccurrenceDeleteConfirm` | ✅ | ❌ |
| Pomodoro reset confirm (2 variants) | `PomodoroResetConfirmModal` | ✅ | ❓ |
| Pomodoro mode-switch confirm | same component | ✅ | ❓ |
| Pomodoro settings | `PomodoroSettingsModal` | ✅ | ❓ |
| Avatar crop | `AvatarCropModal` (Settings) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Task category delete (detach / delete-tasks) | `TaskCategoryDeleteModal` (Settings) | ✅ | ❌ |
| Delete note confirm | NotesPage inline | ✅ | ❌ |
| Add friend | `AddFriendModal` (Friends) | ✅ | 🟡 in shell |
| Remove friend (inline confirm) | FriendsPage inline | ✅ | 🟡 in shell |

## 15. Known gaps — shortlist

Priority candidates, in rough order of user pain:

1. **Mobile dead ends:** Settings, Plan, History, Profile and **Logout** are
   unreachable — the "More" sheet from the `MobileShell` plan doesn't exist yet.
2. **Recurring tasks don't exist on mobile:** can't create, can't edit the
   rule, delete is always single-occurrence (no future/series scopes).
3. **Silent destructive action:** goal swipe-delete on mobile has no
   confirmation; desktop confirms and warns it removes all tasks inside.
4. **`GoalOccurrenceDeleteConfirm` missing on mobile** goal detail — deleting
   scheduled tasks/subtasks skips the occurrence-scope question.
5. **Notes / Settings / Plan render desktop layouts** inside the mobile shell.
6. **Schedule-goal-task-to-date** (`ScheduleGoalTaskButton`) is desktop-only.
7. **Goal sharing is desktop-only:** `GoalDetailMobile` / `GoalsMobileList` have no
   share control, no requests list, no member avatars, and no "completed by"
   attribution. The data is all there server-side — mobile just doesn't render it.
8. **Minor:** completing a goal task from Today (`completion_scope='whole'`)
   doesn't set `completed_by`.

### Unwired components (exist in repo, rendered nowhere)

- `src/features/profile/CharacterOnboarding.tsx`
- `src/features/profile/ProfileDropdown.tsx`

If these are intended for the mobile "More"/profile work, wire them; otherwise
archive them so this doc stays honest.
